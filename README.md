Docker for Shiny Server
=======================

This is a Dockerfile of my own working environment, which is based on rocker/shiny and rocker/hadleyverse. 

The image is available from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/shrektan/shiny/).

## Warning

I'm still working on it. Things will change!

## What's inside

- shiny server
- rstudio server
- database connection, including rsqlserver (using rjdbc), ROracle (with Oracle instant client), RODBC (with unixODBC)

## The goal

I will try to establish a clear and handy working process to establish the R working environment (maybe not suitable for everyone, but at least it would be kind of suitable for people who're working in the financial industry).

## Usage:

In process.
